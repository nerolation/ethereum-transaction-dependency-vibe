# Ethereum Transaction Dependency Graphs

This repository hosts static files for [dependency.pics](https://nerolation.github.io/dependency.pics-static), a visualization of transaction dependencies within Ethereum blocks.

## About

Transaction dependency graphs show how transactions within an Ethereum block depend on each other. Each node represents a transaction, and directed edges show dependencies between them.

This site is maintained by [Toni Wahrst√§tter](https://github.com/nerolation) and updates automatically every 5 minutes with new Ethereum blocks.

## Repository Structure

- `/graphs/` - PNG images of transaction dependency graphs
- `/gantt/` - PNG images of Gantt charts for transaction execution
- `/data/` - JSON files with metadata about the graphs
